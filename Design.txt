Pre-requisite
=============================
Set up three variables in settings
-> BOOK_PATH            -- where the pages to be read are present
-> EXCLUDE_FILE_PATH    -- where the file with words to be excluded are present
-> INDEX_FILE_PATH      -- where the index file for the pages is to be formed

Object Oriented Design
=============================
The code is encapsulated into three main modules:
1st. When the index for all Pages are performed
    Implementation : This task is performed in "read_words" method of "ReadFiles" Class
        The method reads the file as object and iterate through each line's each word at a time
         and checks for the "key" ie the word, that whether it is present or not

2nd. Exclude the words mentioned in exclude-words file:
    Implementation : This task is performed in "exclude_words" method of "ExcludeValues" Class
        The method reads the exclude-words file and checks if that word is present in the index created in first step
        it pops the non required word, creating an index of required words only.

3rd. Write into index file
    Implementation : This task is performed in to write the index object into a file:
        The method "write_into_file" of class "WriteIndexFile" writes the content passed to it in a file.(index here)


Notes
=============================
1. Since all methods in python are public by default, So abstraction cannot be visible clearly here.
2. The code is divided into three different classes to make modularity through encapsulation.
